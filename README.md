# distortion_bar

The task is to create a data-visualization for The Distortion Bar

The bar needs a visualization on how many people are currently in queue to get a cold beer - Data is provided.

The data refreshes every 10 seconds, so if you could set up the script to fetch every 10 seconds or so, that would be great.

## Requirements

- You must create a service that shows the amount of people in queue.
- The service must ask for data regularly, like every 10-20 seconds
- The visualization should be more than just a number
